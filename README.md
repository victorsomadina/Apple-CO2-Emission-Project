# Apple's Journey to CO2 Eradication

# Project Detail
This is a Maven Analytics challenge aimed at visualising Apple's progress in eradicating carbondioxide emission completely by 2030.

# Project Requirement
In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.
For the Maven Environmental Challenge, you'll be working as an independent journalist and data viz enthusiast. Your task is to use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
**Understanding current emission as of 2022, and comparing with the target emission to understand the progress so far**

Applying Dax in Power BI, the percentage emission was calculated and the current emission result is seen at **47.17%** from the baseline emission which is **38.38 million emission**. Meanwhile, the target is to reduce the baseline emission by **75%** thereby getting the emission value to about **28.79 million** by 2030. Current rate shows that the work to eradicate is progressing positively, and at this rate, the target will be reached by year 2030.

**Percentage Year over Year Emission**

Comparing the emission rate across years is very vital in this analysis. In that note, it appears that 2016 has the highest emission reduction **(23%)** compared to other years. So, it is recomendable that same approach is taken in production to ensure reduced emission over the years.

**Understanding Relationship between Revenue and Emission across Years** 

Revenue and sum of emission appears to be negatively correlated. This means that as Revenue increases, Emission decreases. Note: There are other factors that can affect revenue.

**Understanding carbon footprint by product and the activities that have have high emissions**

Understanding these activities gives insight to the areas to be considered the most. The visuals below shows that the manufacturing sector generated the highest emission, about **75%** compared to the total emissions. This sector should be looked into, and appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the emission.

# Recommendation
1. The activities in reducing CO2 emission has so far been yielding positive result and should be continued to reach a needed target by 2030. Meanwhile, the goal by 2030 just reduces emission by 75%. Apple has 
   planned on using carbon offset to eliminate the remaining 25% which is about **9.60 million** emissions.
2. The manufacturing sector which generates the highest emission should be looked into
3. Whatever activity used to reduce emission by 23% in 2016 should be employed in the future to speed up the progress in eradicating CO2 emissions. Using this approach might get the emission to the 75% target 
   before 2030.
