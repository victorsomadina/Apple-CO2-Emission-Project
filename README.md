# Apple's Journey to CO2 Eradication

# Project Detail
This is a Maven Analytics challenge aimed at visualising Apple's progress in eradicating carbondioxide emission completely by 2030.

# Project Requirement
In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.
For the Maven Environmental Challenge, you'll be working as an independent journalist and data viz enthusiast. Your task is to use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
**#Understanding current emission as of 2022, and comparing with the target emission to understand the progress so far**

Applying Dax in Power BI, the percentage emission was calculated and the result is seen at **47.17%** from the baseline emission **38.38 million emission**. Meanwhile, the target is to reduce the baseline emission by **75%** thereby getting the emission value to about **28.79 million** by 2030. Current rate shows that the work to eradicate is progressing positively, and at this rate, the target will be reached by year 2030.
